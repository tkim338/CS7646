This trader uses just Bollinger Bands to generate buy/sell signals.  The trader is set to wake up every 60s and each time, it saves stock price (as the mean of bid and ask price) into a rolling window of length 20 (adding one price and removing one price to maintain a length of 20).  The mean and standard deviation of prices in this window are computed each time the agent wakes up and the current ask and bid prices are compared to the upper and lower Bollinger Bands (mean +/- 2*std_dev).  If both ask and bid prices are lower than the lower Bollinger Band, a buy signal is generated.  If both ask and bid prices are above the upper Bollinger Band, a sell signal is generated.  In all other cases, no signal is generated.

When a signal is generated, a limit order is placed with a limit price equal to the ask price when a buy order is placed and a limit price equal to the bid price when an sell order is placed.  The quantity placed with the order is equal to the maximum order size given by the calling function.  However, 10 limit orders are placed simultaneously to amplify exposure to the stock.  5 mintutes before the trading day ends, any remaining stock holdings are sold or covered.
